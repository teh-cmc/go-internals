# go-internals

`go-internals` is a work-in-progress book about the internals of the Go \(1.10+\) programming language.

## Table of Contents

* [Chapter I: A Primer on Go Assembly](chapter1_assembly_primer.md)
* [Chapter II: Interfaces](chapter2_interfaces.md)
* [Chapter III \(soon!\): The Garbage Collector](chapter3_garbage_collector.md)

*Click [here](https://cmc.gitbook.io/go-internals/) for the GitBook version.*

## Goals

* **Concise**: The book aims to be as concise as possible, encouraging code and diagrams over lengthy prose.
* **Community-effort**: I myself am learning as I go through the writing of this book. I _will_ make mistakes along the way. Hopefully the community can help in pointing out and correcting these mistakes.
* **Beyond the theory**: The book will not just cover the theory, but the actual implementation too. Assumptions will be proven or invalidated via experiments and measurements.
* **Up-to-Date**: The book will try to keep up-to-date with new Go versions being released.
* **Experienced audience**: The Go community has created _loads_ of great introductory material for newcomers. Unfortunately we're still lacking good resources when it comes to the more advanced stuff. This books hopes to help solve this issue.

## Contributing

All kinds of contributions are very much welcome.

Don't hesitate to open an issue for e.g...:

* pointing out technical or english mistakes
* suggesting improvements and/or additions to existing chapters
* suggesting external links that might be of interest
* ..and pretty much anything else you can think of, really!
